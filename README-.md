### What I learned

Slowly working on building my experience using tailwind CSS. Im sure theirs any people who don’t like working with tailwind but for me as a beginner I’ve found it to be absolutely amazing and I would recommend it to anyone just getting started.

### Continued development

I hope once I’ve gained more experience with tailwind to start and introduce some basic Javascript using React.
